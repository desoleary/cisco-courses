# Fundamentals of UI / UX 

#### Method vs Goal

A`method` oriented application should focus on getting the job done in an efficient manner without any complexity. i.e. ATM application where the user does not want to remember the experience

A `goal` oriented application should focus on visual design and functionality for a memorable experience i.e. Diablo 3

#### Usability Heuristics

 1. **Visibility of system status** *(provide current system status e.g. client validation vs server validation)*
 2. **Match between system and real world** *(system should use the user's languages, well organized, use of meaningful icons)*
 3. **User control and freedom** *(Support undo and redo to allow the user to leave or save state)*
 4. **Consistency and Standards** *(Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.)*
 5. **Error Prevention** *(Give **clear error** messages and also helps prevent a problem from occurring in the first place, email client detects user clicking on attachment button without attaching a file then the client warns the user that no file was attached)*
 6. **Recognition rather than recall** *(Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions and options visible)*
 7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use** *(Accelerants - unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user)*
 8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design** *(Remove info that is irrelevant or rarely needed.  Less is more)*
 9. **Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from Errors** Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes) precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a soln. e.g. invalid password, indicate requirements
 10. **Help and Documentation** *(Should be easily searched, and focused on concrete steps to be carried out)*

#### Perception

 - Font size
 - Contrast *(Characters and Background, Low contrast if you want to call out specific elements)*

**Contrast Analyser** [Colour Contrast Chrome Add-On](https://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/tools/color-contrast-chrome/ "Colour Contrast Chrome Add-On")

**Light Source** *- Light should come from the top, shadow at the bottom*
 
#### Comprehension

 - Overall Progress
 - Tabs *(#1 well received option for menus)*
 - Hamburger control *(Menu item when limited space available)*
 - Use icons *(web fonts i.e. font awesome)* [Google font icons](https://design.google.com/icons/) or [Font Awesome icons](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/ "Font Awesome icons")
 - Yes or No *(Choose the action name if possible i.e. Save, Delete)*
